# Real Estate Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Real Estate Data Analysis Project! This project aims to provide valuable insights and analysis of a dataset containing information about various properties in London. Whether you're a real estate enthusiast, data analyst, or someone interested in the London property market, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of the dataset's contents.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project contains details of different properties, including the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, property tenure, presence of gardens, location details, size in square feet, price in pounds, nearest station information, and outer postcodes in London. Through this analysis, we aim to answer key questions and uncover trends related to property prices, property characteristics, geographic patterns, and more.

## Project Objectives

My primary objectives for this project include:

- **Analyzing Property Prices:** We will calculate the average property price and explore the distribution of prices to understand the range of property values.

- **Property Characteristics:** We will investigate the correlation between the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and property prices. We'll also examine how property tenure and the presence of gardens impact property prices.

- **Location Insights:** By analyzing the outer postcodes, we aim to identify geographic trends in property prices and determine if certain areas in London are more expensive than others.

- **Transportation Proximity:** We will explore the relationship between the distance to the nearest station and property prices to assess if proximity to public transportation significantly influences property pricing.

- **Property Types:** We will identify the most common property types and their attributes, including size and price differences.

- **Property Size and Price Correlation:** We will investigate whether there is a correlation between property size (`size_sqft`) and price.
